              <p>
                Best bargain is a fictitious e-commerce store that I was tasked
                with creating as school assignment in my second semester of my
                last year at Noroff. It was my first project using the
                JavaScript framework React. It's also my first time using
                Tailwind instead of Bootstrap. There are still improvements to
                be made and functionalities to be implemented.

              <p>
                ARTrospective is my first year exam project at Noroff. I've used
                Wordpress as a Headless CMS, and created the front end of the
                website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The ARTrospective blog
                is a fictional blog run by three art historians passionate about
                making art history available to everyone. All articles are free
                to read.

                Square Eyes is a cross course project that I made during my

                only. There are still several changes and improvements needed,
                as it's mostly built using HTML and CSS with some JavaScript.
