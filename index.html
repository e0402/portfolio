                Holidaze is my final, last year exam project at Noroff. It's a

                register as a venue manager and list their own venues and/or
                book a listed venue themselves. This app was built using mainly
                React and Tailwind.

              <p>

                JavaScript framework React. It's also my first time using
                Tailwind instead of Bootstrap. There are still improvements to
                be made and functionalities to be implemented.

                making art history available to everyone. All articles are free
                to read.
